# Triton
a coded three tone message system meant to send a coded message over radio and decode received messages of the same kind 
right now its just a few scripts in a folder. its technically working but hasnt been fully tested over a radio yet. 
my goal is to make it more user friendly. 
also as far as i know it only runs in a linux terminal but i havnt tested it in pycharm or anything yet.  


You would have to edit the script called Triton.py so that it will run out of the path the whatever directory you put it in
